Headline: Our Founding Conviction: Education as a Practice of Self-Determination
Noor Community is an international network of educators united by a shared vision of liberation through education. Our work is founded on the conviction that education is a fundamental practice of human development and a vital act of cultural and intellectual preservation (Dewey, 1916). In contexts where educational systems face sustained adversity and fragmentation, the continuity of learning is essential for nurturing the conditions for a future of their own making (Abu-Lughod, 1987). We believe that emergent, grassroots organisations are key to sustaining rich intellectual traditions and fostering the critical faculties necessary for active and engaged citizenship in a complex world (Nusseibeh, 2009; Giroux, 2011). Their agility and deep community accountability allow for a pedagogy that is immediately responsive to the lived realities of learners, a critical element of any effective educational project (Bush & Saltarelli, 2000).
Our work began in 2024 when two British Council teachers, Areej Banat and Gabriel Ishmael Beckford, established a small ELT unit serving students at Al Manar Society, driven by a desire to use their skills to support Palestinian communities. From a handful of volunteers, we have expanded to offer a range of programmes that work alongside Palestinians across the region and in the diaspora. Our approach is grounded in a synthesis of critical educational theories. We see education as a practice of freedom (Freire, 2000), a means to expand the substantive freedoms, or capabilities, that enable individuals to lead lives they have reason to value (Sen, 1999; Nussbaum, 2011). Our goals are therefore to: strengthen and support Palestinian grassroots educational initiatives; support marginalised Palestinian communities in exercising narrative control; build resilient and extensive international networks with Palestinian organisations at the centre; facilitate material development through access to quality education; and to theorise and implement decolonial models of online language education which contest contemporary practices by centering the epistemologies and aspirations of the learners themselves (Smith, 2012).
Headline: The Noor Classroom: Cultivating a Pedagogy of Hope
The classroom represents a space of unique possibility where intellectual curiosity and personal growth can flourish. Acknowledging the cognitive and emotional impact of continuous traumatic stress is therefore a central pedagogical necessity that informs every aspect of our practice (Herman, 1997; Makkawi, 2003). Our commitment to creating predictable, empowering, and relationally secure classrooms is the precondition for all effective learning. This approach informs our commitment to enacting a pedagogy of hope (Freire, 1992), one that is grounded in a critical consciousness of the obstacles to be overcome. The method through which this hope is cultivated is healing-centred engagement, an approach that is politically aware, asset-driven, and focused on the collective well-being and agency required to challenge the sources of adversity (Ginwright, 2016).
This approach is the essential groundwork upon which rigorous intellectual work is built, rather than a therapeutic intervention that could patronise learners. We enact this through a commitment to holistic education, attending to the whole person in a manner that engages their full intellectual and emotional humanity by resisting the separation of the cognitive and the affective (hooks, 1994). This practice is framed as a form of psychosocial accompaniment, a process of "walking with" our students in solidarity (Watkins, 2011). This relational ethos, grounded in a dialogic commitment to mutual recognition and respect (Buber, 1947), creates the conditions for the intellectual risk-taking and collaborative inquiry our programmes demand. It is through this synthesis of safety and challenge that we support the persistence and resilience that enables learning to thrive against the odds (Tamari, 2009).
Headline: A Pedagogy of Possibility: Narrative Control and Imagined Futures
Many of our learners are university students and professionals for whom English competence is a prerequisite for continuing education or career progression. For others, fluency means achieving narrative control, the power to articulate their own experiences, histories, and aspirations on a global stage. This is the essential humanistic act of self-representation against external narratives that seek to define and confine (Said, 1978; Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, 1986). This involves developing the semiotic power to re-signify experience and contest dominant public transcripts (Scott, 1990). Our curriculum is designed to equip students with the sophisticated linguistic tools necessary for this vital work, enabling them to master the genres of professional and public communication (Swales, 1990).
This extends beyond technical proficiency into the realm of the speculative imagination. Our use of project-based learning, live-action roleplay, and worldbuilding allows learners to inhabit new professional identities and perform competence in a co-constructed space of possibility (Gee, 2000). These speculative practices, whether pitching a tech start-up or managing an arts collective, enable students to rehearse and embody agentive future selves, thereby projecting and performing possible futures. This exercise is central to expanding their 'capacity to aspire' (Appadurai, 2004). This investment in their imagined future selves is a powerful driver of identity formation and the acquisition of language alongside a full range of multimodal and translingual communicative repertoires (Norton, 2013; Canagarajah, 2013). Narrative control is thus enacted on two levels: the personal capacity for self-definition, and the collective power of students to co-author the story and democratic direction of the Noor Community itself.
Headline: Noor: A Community of Practice
Noor is more than a school; we are a community of practice where students, mentors, teachers, and staff are co-learners in a shared enterprise (Wenger, 1998). This horizontal structure is a conscious political choice, designed to dismantle the expert/client binaries that often characterise North-South educational encounters (Escobar, 1995). This horizontalism resists the traditional, hierarchical structures that can pervade international education initiatives (Illich, 1971). We are committed to an ethos that respects the complex, lived experiences of all our members, consciously working against the essentialising gaze that can accompany cross-cultural work (Abu-Lughod, 1991).
This model provides a deeply humanising space for our educators. In a professional field often marked by atomisation and alienation, Noor offers a space to reconnect with the craft of teaching in a purposeful context (Palmer, 2007). Our commitment to care extends to our teachers; their well-being is of equal importance within our community. This is a central element of our pedagogy; a supported, critically reflective practitioner is an essential partner in the student's own journey of empowerment (Brookfield, 1995). Participation is an act of reciprocity and mutual learning, where volunteers gain advanced training in trauma-informed pedagogy and educational technology, and become part of a professional network grounded in solidarity. This practice of mutual aid fosters a community where all members, regardless of their role, are engaged in a shared process of discovery and growth (Spade, 2020; Boud & Miller, 1996).
Our Vision Page
Headline: Our Vision
Our work is founded on the conviction that education, particularly in the field of language learning, is a fundamental practice of human development and a vital investment in a more hopeful future. In contexts marked by sustained adversity, the classroom represents a space of unique possibility; a carefully cultivated environment where intellectual curiosity, personal growth, and a durable sense of purpose can flourish. Our pedagogical vision is therefore dedicated to creating academically rigorous learning experiences that are also deeply affirming of each student's potential. We are committed to an educational practice that cultivates in learners the sophisticated linguistic and analytical tools necessary to navigate a complex world, to make a substantial contribution to their communities, and to possess the tools to build futures of their own making.
A central element of this vision involves expanding the substantive freedoms, or capabilities, that enable individuals to lead lives they have reason to value (Sen, 1999; Nussbaum, 2011). Far from being a static credential, we understand language proficiency as a dynamic capability that enhances a student’s agency and enlarges their capacity to aspire to and achieve a wider range of personal and professional goals (Appadurai, 2004). Our curriculum therefore emphasizes the active cultivation of creativity and criticality, as opposed to the passive transmission of knowledge, so they may use language to solve problems, articulate their vision with confidence, and engage productively with the challenges and opportunities that lie before them.
The cultivation of individual agency is an inherently social process, nurtured within supportive communities of practice where learning is understood as a collective and interactive endeavor (Wenger, 1998). Our classrooms are structured as horizontal, collaborative spaces where knowledge is co-constructed through respectful dialogue and mutual inquiry, fostering an engaged pedagogy of shared responsibility (hooks, 1994; Freire, 2000). It is this ethos of mutual respect and collective effort that creates the conditions for intellectual risk-taking, allowing students to develop a deep investment in their own learning and that of their peers (Norton, 2013).
From this secure foundation of a collaborative learning community, our pedagogy extends outward to engage with the wider world. We aim to cultivate a form of rooted cosmopolitanism, wherein a strong and confident sense of local identity becomes the very basis for ethical and effective global engagement (Appiah, 2006). Our approach is designed to develop a sophisticated intercultural communicative competence, equipping students with the skills and critical awareness to participate in a global dialogue as active contributors who can represent their own perspectives, rather than as passive recipients of information (Byram, 1997; Kramsch, 1993). English is thus framed as a language of connection, a vital tool for building bridges of understanding in a pluralistic world.
Achieving these aims requires a pedagogy that integrates the cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions of learning. We incorporate arts-based and creative methodologies to engage the whole person, fostering the positive affective states of curiosity, confidence, and intellectual joy that are essential for motivation and the emergent complexities of language acquisition (Larsen-Freeman & Cameron, 2008). This process is designed to foster a mature learner autonomy, which we define as the capacity for students to take conscious ownership of their educational journeys through metacognitive awareness, strategic planning, and critical self-reflection (Benson, 2011).
This entire pedagogical framework rests upon an ethical commitment to the well-being of our students, recognising that all profound learning depends upon a foundation of safety and trust. Acknowledging the cognitive and emotional impact of continuous traumatic stress is therefore a central pedagogical necessity that informs every aspect of our practice (Straker, 2001; Herman, 1997). Our commitment to creating predictable, empowering, and relationally secure classrooms is thus the precondition for all effective learning. This practice of psychosocial accompaniment, grounded in solidarity and care, ensures that the classroom remains a space for intellectual exploration and personal growth, allowing students to build the resilience and confidence they need to thrive both academically and in their lives beyond our walls (Watkins, 2011).
What We Do Page
Headline: Our Educational Programmes
Our educational programmes are the practical application of our pedagogical vision. Each programme provides an academically rigorous and affirming experience, equipping learners with sophisticated linguistic and analytical tools. Far from being a passive transmission of knowledge, our curriculum is founded on collaborative, problem-posing methodologies that cultivate creativity and criticality. The following descriptions outline how each programme applies these principles to foster individual agency within a supportive community of practice and open pathways to a wider range of personal and professional futures.
Programme: General and Business English: Task-Based and Project-Based Learning
Our General and Business English courses utilise the principles of Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT), where language is acquired through the process of solving tangible, real-world problems (Ellis, 2003; Willis, 1996). Acknowledging that limited internet bandwidth can preclude a conventional flipped classroom model, we have developed a system of robust in-class and out-of-class scaffolding. Pre-class activities, which include interactive chatbot-based micro-lessons, provide learners with initial input and opportunities for practice. This preparation ensures that classroom time is dedicated to dynamic, collaborative engagement.
This approach is designed to cultivate a form of ‘rooted cosmopolitanism’ (Appiah, 2006), where students bring their local identities and cultural perspectives to bear on complex global scenarios. We deliberately use tasks that present complex triangulations, as opposed to essentialising models of intercultural communication that present static national styles (Holliday, 2010). An example might involve a Palestinian arts collective negotiating an exhibition with both their diasporic counterparts in Scotland and local museum curators. Other scenarios could include a Gazan tech start-up pitching to international investors, a social enterprise developing a sustainable business plan, or a media team creating content for a global audience. These tasks demand sophisticated negotiation, creative problem-solving, and the deployment of a wide range of communicative strategies, reflecting the reality of contemporary global engagement (Canagarajah, 2013; Kramsch, 1993).
By situating students in these roles as entrepreneurs, artists, or community leaders, the curriculum works to expand their ‘substantive freedoms’ and their ‘capacity to aspire’ (Sen, 1999; Appadurai, 2004). In a context marked by foreclosure, our pedagogy insists on possibility. This culminates in project-based modules that incorporate elements of live-action roleplay and worldbuilding. Here, students inhabit persistent professional roles within a co-constructed context, for instance managing a record label or an architectural firm for several weeks. This sustained, arts-based methodology allows learners to engage in a form of speculative practice, projecting and performing possible futures and professional identities (Norton, 2013; Gee, 2000). This approach reframes Business English as a site for creative play and critical inquiry, understanding the economy less as an abstract system and more as the dynamic sum of human relationships and activities (Polanyi, 2001; Graeber, 2011).
Programme: Writing Programme: A Genre-Based Pedagogy for Professional Communication
Integrated within our Business English curriculum, the writing programme employs a genre-based pedagogy to support students in developing conscious control over written communication (Swales, 1990; Martin & Rose, 2008). The core principle is that understanding the social purpose and conventional structures of a text is key to achieving one's communicative goals. By deconstructing and then constructing key professional genres, such as CVs, business plans, financial statements, and persuasive emails, students learn to analyse audience, purpose, and context to engineer a desired outcome.
This process equips students to take command of the writing process and narrate their own histories and capabilities effectively. It is a crucial skill for positioning themselves in professional fields and securing their objectives (Hyland, 2007). The programme is enacted within a horizontal, collaborative ethos; peer feedback is integral to the writing process, reinforcing the classroom as a ‘community of practice’ where knowledge and skills are co-constructed through mutual inquiry and shared responsibility (Wenger, 1998; hooks, 1994).
Programme: English for Academic Purposes (EAP)
Our EAP programme is designed to provide students with the specific linguistic and analytical competencies required for success in higher education. The curriculum is systematically structured around the Oxford EAP series, which offers a robust framework for developing critical thinking, academic argumentation, and the ability to engage with complex scholarly sources (De Chazal & McCarter, 2012).
A key feature of our programme is the use of portfolio-based assessment. This approach fosters a more profound and sustained engagement with the learning process than traditional testing models. The portfolio serves as a vehicle for students to curate their work, reflect on their progress, and set future learning goals, thereby promoting the ‘mature learner autonomy’ that is central to our pedagogical vision (Benson, 2011; Hamp-Lyons & Condon, 2000). This method allows for a more holistic evaluation that captures the emergent and complex nature of academic language development (Larsen-Freeman & Cameron, 2008).
Programme: Mentoring Programme: Scaffolding Professional Futures
The mentoring programme is a three-month structured experience that guides students in the planning and execution of a self-directed project. Each project is required to have a concrete, practical outcome in the domain of professional development, such as creating a professional portfolio, or in tangible skill-building, for example developing a small-scale coding project. While language development may be an ancillary benefit, the programme’s primary focus is on fostering agency and purpose.
The process is scaffolded by goal-setting theory, which demonstrates that specific, challenging, and achievable goals are strong drivers of motivation and performance (Locke & Latham, 2002). Students first work to ensure their project is well-scoped before being paired with a mentor who provides guidance and support.
This programme is conceived as a practice of accompaniment, as opposed to ‘development’ in its traditional, top-down sense. We are informed by a critical perspective that challenges the universalist and often neo-colonial assumptions embedded in mainstream development discourse (Kapoor, 2008; Escobar, 1995). The mentor-mentee relationship is therefore framed as a partnership grounded in solidarity and care, designed to support the student’s own vision. By facilitating the successful completion of a personally significant project, the programme aims to enhance students’ capabilities and their confidence to pursue lives they have reason to value (Watkins, 2011; Sen, 1999).

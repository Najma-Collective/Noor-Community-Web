                    Noor Community is an international network of educators united by a shared vision of liberation through education. Our work is founded on the conviction that education is a fundamental practice of human development and a vital act of cultural and intellectual preservation (Dewey, 1916). In contexts where educational systems face sustained adversity and fragmentation, the continuity of learning is essential for nurturing the conditions for a future of their own making (Abu-Lughod, 1987). We believe that emergent, grassroots organisations are key to sustaining rich intellectual traditions and fostering the critical faculties necessary for active and engaged citizenship in a complex world (Nusseibeh, 2009; Giroux, 2011). Their agility and deep community accountability allow for a pedagogy that is immediately responsive to the lived realities of learners, a critical element of any effective educational project (Bush & Saltarelli, 2000).

                    Our work began in 2024 when two British Council teachers, Areej Banat and Gabriel Ishmael Beckford, established a small ELT unit serving students at Al Manar Society, driven by a desire to use their skills to support Palestinian communities. From a handful of volunteers, we have expanded to offer a range of programmes that work alongside Palestinians across the region and in the diaspora. Our approach is grounded in a synthesis of critical educational theories. We see education as a practice of freedom (Freire, 2000), a means to expand the substantive freedoms, or capabilities, that enable individuals to lead lives they have reason to value (Sen, 1999; Nussbaum, 2011). Our goals are therefore to: strengthen and support Palestinian grassroots educational initiatives; support marginalised Palestinian communities in exercising narrative control; build resilient and extensive international networks with Palestinian organisations at the centre; facilitate material development through access to quality education; and to theorise and implement decolonial models of online language education which contest contemporary practices by centering the epistemologies and aspirations of the learners themselves (Smith, 2012).

            <h2>The Noor Classroom: Cultivating a Pedagogy of Hope</h2>

                    The classroom represents a space of unique possibility where intellectual curiosity and personal growth can flourish. Acknowledging the cognitive and emotional impact of continuous traumatic stress is therefore a central pedagogical necessity that informs every aspect of our practice (Herman, 1997; Makkawi, 2003). Our commitment to creating predictable, empowering, and relationally secure classrooms is the precondition for all effective learning. This approach informs our commitment to enacting a pedagogy of hope (Freire, 1992), one that is grounded in a critical consciousness of the obstacles to be overcome. The method through which this hope is cultivated is healing-centred engagement, an approach that is politically aware, asset-driven, and focused on the collective well-being and agency required to challenge the sources of adversity (Ginwright, 2016).
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: var(--step-0); line-height: var(--leading-loose);">
                    This approach is the essential groundwork upon which rigorous intellectual work is built, rather than a therapeutic intervention that could patronise learners. We enact this through a commitment to holistic education, attending to the whole person in a manner that engages their full intellectual and emotional humanity by resisting the separation of the cognitive and the affective (hooks, 1994). This practice is framed as a form of psychosocial accompaniment, a process of "walking with" our students in solidarity (Watkins, 2011). This relational ethos, grounded in a dialogic commitment to mutual recognition and respect (Buber, 1947), creates the conditions for the intellectual risk-taking and collaborative inquiry our programmes demand. It is through this synthesis of safety and challenge that we support the persistence and resilience that enables learning to thrive against the odds (Tamari, 2009).

            <h2>A Pedagogy of Possibility: Narrative Control and Imagined Futures</h2>

                    Many of our learners are university students and professionals for whom English competence is a prerequisite for continuing education or career progression. For others, fluency means achieving narrative control, the power to articulate their own experiences, histories, and aspirations on a global stage. This is the essential humanistic act of self-representation against external narratives that seek to define and confine (Said, 1978; Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, 1986). This involves developing the semiotic power to re-signify experience and contest dominant public transcripts (Scott, 1990). Our curriculum is designed to equip students with the sophisticated linguistic tools necessary for this vital work, enabling them to master the genres of professional and public communication (Swales, 1990).
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: var(--step-0); line-height: var(--leading-loose);">
                    This extends beyond technical proficiency into the realm of the speculative imagination. Our use of project-based learning, live-action roleplay, and worldbuilding allows learners to inhabit new professional identities and perform competence in a co-constructed space of possibility (Gee, 2000). These speculative practices, whether pitching a tech start-up or managing an arts collective, enable students to rehearse and embody agentive future selves, thereby projecting and performing possible futures. This exercise is central to expanding their 'capacity to aspire' (Appadurai, 2004). This investment in their imagined future selves is a powerful driver of identity formation and the acquisition of language alongside a full range of multimodal and translingual communicative repertoires (Norton, 2013; Canagarajah, 2013). Narrative control is thus enacted on two levels: the personal capacity for self-definition, and the collective power of students to co-author the story and democratic direction of the Noor Community itself.

                    Noor is more than a school; we are a community of practice where students, mentors, teachers, and staff are co-learners in a shared enterprise (Wenger, 1998). This horizontal structure is a conscious political choice, designed to dismantle the expert/client binaries that often characterise North-South educational encounters (Escobar, 1995). This horizontalism resists the traditional, hierarchical structures that can pervade international education initiatives (Illich, 1971). We are committed to an ethos that respects the complex, lived experiences of all our members, consciously working against the essentialising gaze that can accompany cross-cultural work (Abu-Lughod, 1991).

                    This model provides a deeply humanising space for our educators. In a professional field often marked by atomisation and alienation, Noor offers a space to reconnect with the craft of teaching in a purposeful context (Palmer, 2007). Our commitment to care extends to our teachers; their well-being is of equal importance within our community. This is a central element of our pedagogy; a supported, critically reflective practitioner is an essential partner in the student's own journey of empowerment (Brookfield, 1995). Participation is an act of reciprocity and mutual learning, where volunteers gain advanced training in trauma-informed pedagogy and educational technology, and become part of a professional network grounded in solidarity. This practice of mutual aid fosters a community where all members, regardless of their role, are engaged in a shared process of discovery and growth (Spade, 2020; Boud & Miller, 1996).
